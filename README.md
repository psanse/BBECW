An exact algorithm for the edge weighted maximum clique problem (MEWCP) published in *A new branch-and-bound algorithm for the maximum edge-weighted clique problem* Eur. J. Oper. Res. 278(1): 76-90 (2019).

This repository contains the dataset tested in the referre

CliSAT: A SAT-based exact algorithm for hard maximum clique problems by Pablo San Segundo, Stefano Coniglio, Fabio Furini and Ivana Ljubic. 

The instances employed in the tests are inside the instances folder in their original format.

A Linux release of CliSAT is provided in the bin folder, together with a comparison performance report file CliSAT.appendix.pdf (which serves as appendix to the article).
